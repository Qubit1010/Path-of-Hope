          <p>
            Path of Hope kicked off the holiday season by organizing a winter
            clothing drive in partnership with a local school district. Over the
            course of several weeks, we collected books, toys, and warm winter
            clothing from three school campuses, with the goal of providing
            support to those in need during the colder months.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thanks to the generosity of our partners and supporters, we were
            able to gather more than 45 boxes of donated items, which included
            coats, hats, gloves, and other essential winter gear. These
            donations were then distributed to families and individuals in the
            community who were experiencing hardship, providing warmth, comfort,
            and a sense of hope during the holiday season.
