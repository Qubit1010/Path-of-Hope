          <p>
            Path of Hope organized a highly successful bake sale to raise funds
            for our programs and services, in partnership with a group of
            dedicated student volunteers. Over the course of several weeks, our
            volunteers worked tirelessly to bake and prepare an array of
            delicious treats, including cookies, cupcakes, brownies, and more.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thanks to the hard work of our volunteers and the generosity of our
            supporters, we were able to raise an impressive 11,000 riyals in
            just a few hours.
          </p>

          <p>
            This event not only provided much-needed funding for our
            organization but also provided an opportunity for our volunteers to
            develop their skills, connect with their community, and make a
            meaningful impact in the lives of others. By coming together and
            working towards a common goal, we were able to achieve great success
            and create a positive change in our community.
