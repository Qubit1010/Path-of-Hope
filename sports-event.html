            Path of Hope organized a fun and engaging sports event in
            partnership with a local basketball academy. The event featured over
            100 attendees, including players, spectators, and supporters, who
            came together to enjoy a day of basketball and community building.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the event, we divided players into teams representing different
            charity groups, giving them the opportunity to compete for a good
            cause. Spectators also had the chance to participate in fun
            activities and games, with prizes and giveaways provided by our
            sponsors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Adding to the festive atmosphere, we also brought in a food truck to
            provide tasty snacks and refreshments for all attendees. Thanks to
            the generosity of our sponsors and supporters, we were able to raise
            around 10,000 riyals in funds, which will go towards the charities
            represented.
          </p>

          <p>
            This event not only provided a fun and exciting experience for all
            involved but also helped to promote our organization's mission and
            values in the community. By creating opportunities for people to
            come together and make a positive impact, we are paving the way for
            a brighter future for all.
